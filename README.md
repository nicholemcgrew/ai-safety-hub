# AI Safety Hub

A public, evidence-based platform for AI safety, governance, regulation tracking, and accountable AI systems.

This project is intentionally designed as a **long-term learning lab** and **production-grade system** that integrates:

- Frontend engineering
- Backend architecture
- API design (OpenAPI)
- Accessibility (508 / WCAG)
- SEO
- Data engineering & ETL
- Security and DevOps foundations

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Educate the public on AI safety and governance using verifiable sources
- Track AI regulations, incidents, and research transparently
- Build trustworthy, auditable AI-adjacent systems
- Serve as a hands-on learning platform for modern system architecture

---

## 🧠 Architectural Philosophy

This project follows a **systems-first** approach:

- **React** for accessible, human-facing interfaces
- **Node.js** for backend logic and APIs
- **OpenAPI** for explicit, documented API contracts
- **PostgreSQL** (planned) as the source of truth
- **Python ETL** (planned) for data ingestion and transformation
- **DevOps practices** for reliability, security, and scale

Even when components live in the same codebase, they are treated as **separate responsibilities**.
